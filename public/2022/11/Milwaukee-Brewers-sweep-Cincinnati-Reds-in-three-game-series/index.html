        <h1 id="Milwaukee-Brewers-sweep-Cincinnati-Reds-in-three-game-series"><a href="#Milwaukee-Brewers-sweep-Cincinnati-Reds-in-three-game-series" class="headerlink" title="Milwaukee Brewers sweep Cincinnati Reds in three-game series"></a>Milwaukee Brewers sweep Cincinnati Reds in three-game series</h1><p>The Milwaukee Brewers completed a three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds with an 8-2 victory on Sunday at Great American Ball Park. It was the first time the Brewers had swept the Reds since taking four games from them in 2006.</p>
<p>Brewers starting pitcher Junior Guerra (1-0) allowed two runs on five hits over six innings to earn the win. Anthony Swarzak pitched a perfect seventh inning and Matt Albers allowed two runs in the eighth but got out of a bases-loaded jam to preserve the victory.</p>
<p>Brewers shortstop Orlando Arcia hit his first home run of the season, a solo shot in the fourth inning, and second baseman Neil Walker drove in three runs with a pair of doubles.</p>
<p>Reds starter Jackson Stephens (0-1) allowed four runs on six hits over four innings in taking the loss.</p>
<h1 id="St-Louis-Cardinals-win-two-out-of-three-against-the-Chicago-Cubs"><a href="#St-Louis-Cardinals-win-two-out-of-three-against-the-Chicago-Cubs" class="headerlink" title="St. Louis Cardinals win two out of three against the Chicago Cubs"></a>St. Louis Cardinals win two out of three against the Chicago Cubs</h1><p>The Cardinals kicked off their three game series against the Chicago Cubs on Monday Night with a bang. Rookie pitcher, Miles Mikolas started the game and pitched brilliantly allowing only two hits over six innings. The Cardinals offense was also firing on all cylinders as they scored six runs off of Cubs starter, Jose Quintana. Yadier Molina led the way for the Cardinals offensively going 3 for 4 with two RBIs. The Cardinals would go on to win the game by a score of 6-2.</p>
<p>The Cubs would get their revenge in game two of the series, as they beat the Cardinals by a score of 5-2. Javier Baez once again led the way offensively for the Cubs, as he went 2 for 4 with three RBIs. Jon Lester got the start for the Cubs and pitched well, allowing only two runs over six innings.</p>
<p>The Cardinals would ultimately prevail in the series though, as they won game three by a score of 5-4. Matt Carpenter led the way offensively for St. Louis, as he went 3 for 4 with two RBIs and two home runs. Rookie pitcher Alex Reyes started the game for St. Louis and pitched well, allowing only one run over five innings.</p>
<h1 id="A-Look-Back-at-the-St-Louis-Cardinals-2017-Season"><a href="#A-Look-Back-at-the-St-Louis-Cardinals-2017-Season" class="headerlink" title="A Look Back at the St. Louis Cardinals 2017 Season"></a>A Look Back at the St. Louis Cardinals 2017 Season</h1><p>The St. Louis Cardinals had an up and down 2017 season, but ultimately failed to make it to the playoffs. The season started off poorly for them, as they went just 10-14 in April. They would turn things around in May however, going 17-8 to bring their record up to 27-22 overall. June was another good month for them, as they went 16-10 to bring their record up to 43-32 overall.</p>
<p>July was not as good of a month for them however, as they went just 11-13 to bring their record down to 54-45 overall. August was also a rough month for them, as they went just 9-15 to bring their record down to 63-60 overall heading into September. The Cardinals would then go on an incredible run in September, going 18-8 to finish with an 81-81 overall record and narrowly missing out on a playoff spot.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights from the 2017 season include Yadier Molina getting elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame, Tommy Pham having a breakout year offensively, and Carlos Martinez finishing third in Cy Young voting.</p>
<h1 id="Pittsburgh-Pirates-dominate-the-Miami-Marlins-in-four-game-series"><a href="#Pittsburgh-Pirates-dominate-the-Miami-Marlins-in-four-game-series" class="headerlink" title="Pittsburgh Pirates dominate the Miami Marlins in four-game series"></a>Pittsburgh Pirates dominate the Miami Marlins in four-game series</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Pirates hosted the Miami Marlins for a four-game series at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pirates won all four games of the series, outscoring the Marlins 21-7 in the process.</p>
<p>The first game of the series was on Thursday, May 3rd. The Pirates jumped out to an early lead, scoring four runs in the first inning. They added two more runs in the third inning, and held on to win 5-3.</p>
<p>In game two of the series on Friday, May 4th, the Pirates scored six runs in the first inning and never looked back. They went on to win 10-2.</p>
<p>In game three of the series on Saturday, May 5th, Pirates starter Ivan Nova pitched seven shutout innings and got the win. The Marlins only managed one hit against Nova, and were shut out for the second consecutive day. The Pirates won 1-0.</p>
<p>In game four of the series on Sunday, May 6th, Josh Bell hit a home run in each of his first two at bats. He became only the second player in MLB history to do so. The Pirates won 8-2 and completed their sweep of the Marlins.</p>
<p>The Pirates are now 19-19 on the season and sit two games behind first place Cincinnati in the NL Central division.</p>
<h1 id="Johnny-Cueto-pitches-complete-game-shutout-for-the-Cincinnati-Reds-against-the-Milwaukee-Brewers"><a href="#Johnny-Cueto-pitches-complete-game-shutout-for-the-Cincinnati-Reds-against-the-Milwaukee-Brewers" class="headerlink" title="Johnny Cueto pitches complete game shutout for the Cincinnati Reds against the Milwaukee Brewers"></a>Johnny Cueto pitches complete game shutout for the Cincinnati Reds against the Milwaukee Brewers</h1><p>Cueto pitched a complete game shutout against the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday, allowing just four hits while striking out 10. It was his fourth complete game of the season and his second shutout.</p>
<p>“I feel really good,” Cueto said after the game. “I felt like I had good command of my fastball and my slider.”</p>
<p>Cueto has been one of the best pitchers in baseball this season. He is 9-5 with a 2.47 ERA and has struck out 103 batters in 107 innings. He has also walked just 22 batters.</p>
<p>The Reds are in last place in the NL Central, but Cueto has been one of their few bright spots this season. He is scheduled to start for the Reds in the All-Star Game next week.</p>
<p>“He’s been our best pitcher this year,” Reds manager Bryan Price said. “He’s been lights out.”</p>
<h1 id="Ryan-Braun-homers-twice-for-the-Milwaukee-Brewers-in-victory-over-the-Cincinnati-Reds"><a href="#Ryan-Braun-homers-twice-for-the-Milwaukee-Brewers-in-victory-over-the-Cincinnati-Reds" class="headerlink" title="Ryan Braun homers twice for the Milwaukee Brewers in victory over the Cincinnati Reds"></a>Ryan Braun homers twice for the Milwaukee Brewers in victory over the Cincinnati Reds</h1><p>Milwaukee, Wisconsin - The Milwaukee Brewers beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-5 on Thursday night. Ryan Braun had two home runs in the victory.</p>
<p>Braun went 2-for-4 at the plate with two homers, four RBIs and three runs scored. He now has six homers on the season.</p>
<p>“I feel good. I’m just trying to stay within myself and not do too much,” Braun said. “I’m just trying to put a good swing on the ball.”</p>
<p>The Brewers opened up a 7-1 lead after five innings, but the Reds made it interesting late. Cincinnati scored four runs in the eighth inning, but Milwaukee’s bullpen was able to hold on for the win.</p>
<p>“You’re never out of a game with that lineup over there,” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said of the Reds. “They can put up some runs quick.”</p>
<p>Jhoulys Chacin (2-1) picked up the win for Milwaukee, pitching six innings and allowing one run on six hits while striking out six batters. Amir Garrett (0-3) took the loss for Cincinnati.</p>
