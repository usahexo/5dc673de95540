#  Rich Geyser's Casino Opens Amid Controversy 

Atlantic City, NJ - The disputed Rich Geyser's Casino has finally opened to the public. The $1.5 billion complex has been at the center of a legal battle since it was announced in late 2014. 

The casino is the brainchild of self-made millionaire Rich Geyser, who has been involved in numerous legal disputes over the years. His critics say that he is a criminal mastermind, while his supporters call him a visionary entrepreneur. 

Regardless of his reputation, there is no doubt that Rich Geyser's Casino is a spectacular sight. The neon-lit tower dominates the Atlantic City skyline, and the interior is just as impressive. There are dozens of gaming tables and hundreds of slot machines, as well as restaurants, bars, and a luxury hotel. 

The opening of Rich Geyser's Casino has been met with mixed reactions. Some people are excited to have a new place to gamble, while others fear that it will only contribute to the city's already high crime rate. Mayor Frank Gilliam Jr. has voiced his support for the casino, but many residents are concerned that it will bring more violence and poverty to Atlantic City. 

Only time will tell if Rich Geyser's Casino is successful or not. But one thing is for sure: it's definitely made a statement.

#  Geyser Gaming CEO: The casino is open, get over it! 

In a recent interview with Geyser Gaming CEO, Lucas Miller, he boldly stated that the casino is open and there is no need to be concerned. 

Miller says "The casino is open and it will stay open. Get over it." in response to concerns from the public about the newly built casino. Miller also went on to say that the casino will be a great addition to the community and bring more jobs and revenue to the area.

When asked about what type of gaming the casino would offer, Miller said "We will have everything from slots and table games to poker and bingo. We want to make sure that everyone can find something they enjoy."

The casino has been under construction for over a year and has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some are excited for the new businesses and jobs that it will bring to the area, while others are concerned about increased traffic and crime rates.

Miller addressed these concerns saying "We have done our best to plan for every possible scenario. We have added additional security measures and we are working closely with local law enforcement to make sure everyone is safe."

The casino is set to open in early 2019 and will offer over 250 slot machines, 14 table games, and a poker room.

#  Judge orders casino closed after allegations of attempted bribery 

After allegations of attempted bribery at the casino, a judge has ordered the casino to be closed.

According to reports, a casino executive allegedly offered a $1 million bribe to a state lawmaker in order to get a bill passed that would benefit the casino.

The proposed bill would have allowed the casino to operate on Sundays, which is currently not allowed under state law.

As a result of the allegations, the judge has ordered the casino to be closed until further notice.

#  FBI raid Geyser Gaming's casino in Colusa County 

Geyser Gaming's casino in Colusa County was raided by the FBI on Wednesday.

The raid comes as a surprise to many, as Geyser Gaming is a relatively small casino operator. The company has just three casinos in operation, all of which are located in California.

Sources close to the investigation say that the FBI is investigating allegations of money laundering at the casino. It is believed that Geyser Gaming may have been used to launder money for organized crime groups.

The raid took place just hours after Geyser Gaming announced that it had agreed to be acquired by an unnamed company. It is not clear if the raid is related to the acquisition agreement.

Geyser Gaming has issued a statement saying that it is cooperating with the FBI and will continue to do so. The company has also said that it intends to fully cooperate with any investigations that may take place.

Attorney General investigates Rich Geyser's casino

In light of the recent closure of three casinos in the state, Attorney General Jeff Landry has announced that his office will be investigating Rich Geyser's casino.

"We're going to be looking into this casino to see if any laws were violated," said Landry. "The people of Louisiana deserve to know that their money is being handled fairly and honestly."

Geyser's casino has been at the center of some controversy in recent months. In February, shortly after the casino opened, it was sued by two former employees who alleged that they were not paid overtime wages.

Landry said that his office will be interviewing both employees and customers of the casino in order to get a better understanding of what happened there. He also encouraged anyone with information about the casino to come forward and contact his office.

"We take allegations of wrongdoing seriously," said Landry. "And we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and hold those responsible accountable."
