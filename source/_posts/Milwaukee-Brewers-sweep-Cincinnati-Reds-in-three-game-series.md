Brewers starting pitcher Junior Guerra (1-0) allowed two runs on five hits over six innings to earn the win. Anthony Swarzak pitched a perfect seventh inning and Matt Albers allowed two runs in the eighth but got out of a bases-loaded jam to preserve the victory.

Brewers shortstop Orlando Arcia hit his first home run of the season, a solo shot in the fourth inning, and second baseman Neil Walker drove in three runs with a pair of doubles.

Reds starter Jackson Stephens (0-1) allowed four runs on six hits over four innings in taking the loss.

The Cardinals would go on to win the game by a score of 6-2.

The Cubs would get their revenge in game two of the series, as they beat the Cardinals by a score of 5-2.

# A Look Back at the St. Louis Cardinals 2017 Season

The St. Louis Cardinals had an up and down 2017 season, but ultimately failed to make it to the playoffs. The season started off poorly for them, as they went just 10-14 in April. They would turn things around in May however, going 17-8 to bring their record up to 27-22 overall. June was another good month for them, as they went 16-10 to bring their record up to 43-32 overall.

July was not as good of a month for them however, as they went just 11-13 to bring their record down to 54-45 overall. August was also a rough month for them, as they went just 9-15 to bring their record down to 63-60 overall heading into September. The Cardinals would then go on an incredible run in September, going 18-8 to finish with an 81-81 overall record and narrowly missing out on a playoff spot.

Some of the highlights from the 2017 season include Yadier Molina getting elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame, Tommy Pham having a breakout year offensively, and Carlos Martinez finishing third in Cy Young voting.
