#  Nevada becomes first state to legalize online gambling

Nevada is known for being a pioneer in the gambling industry. Now, the state is at the forefront of online gambling, becoming the first in the nation to legalize it.

Governor Brian Sandoval signed Senate Bill 311 into law on October 1, 2013. The bill allows licensed Nevada casinos to offer online poker, blackjack, and other casino games to residents of the state.

The move has been hailed as a positive step for Nevada's economy. Online gambling is expected to bring in an additional $100 million in revenue each year. This will help support the state's schools and colleges, as well as its infrastructure and public services.

Online gambling is already a major industry worldwide. In 2012, it generated revenues of more than $35 billion. By legalizing it in Nevada, Governor Sandoval has put his state in a strong position to take advantage of this growing market.

Many experts believe that online gambling will soon be legalized in other states as well. This could create a massive new market for Nevada's casinos.

#  California poised to legalize online gambling

Last week, Assemblymember Adam Gray (D-Merced) introduced Assembly Bill 2863, which would legalize and regulate online gambling in California. The legislation is supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders, including the tribes, cardrooms, and racetracks.

“This is an important bill that will allow California to generate much-needed revenue while protecting consumers and preserving jobs,” said Assemblymember Gray. “I am grateful for the support of so many stakeholders who have worked tirelessly to put this bill together.”

AB 2863 would establish a regulatory framework for online poker, blackjack, slots, and other casino games. The bill would require operators to be licensed by the state and would impose a 15% tax on gross gaming revenue.

“AB 2863 provides a thoughtful approach to legalizing internet gambling in California that includes robust consumer protections,” said Greg Lambrecht of the Poker Players Alliance. “We encourage the legislature to move swiftly on this important issue so that Californians can enjoy the same safe and regulated online experience as players in other states.”

 AB 2863 has been referred to the Assembly Committee on Governmental Organization.

#  New Jersey votes to legalize several forms of online gambling

In a surprise move, the New Jersey state legislature voted on Monday to legalize several forms of online gambling, including poker and casino games. The vote was close, but the measure passed and is now on its way to Governor Chris Christie’s desk for signing.

The debate in the state legislature had been heated, with opponents arguing that online gambling would be harmful to society as a whole. But supporters countered that the new law would bring much-needed revenue to the state government, as well as create jobs in the casino industry.

Governor Christie has not yet said whether he will sign the bill into law, but it seems likely that he will do so. If he does, New Jersey will become the third state in the US to legalize online gambling, after Nevada and Delaware.

Online gambling has been growing in popularity all over the world, and analysts estimate that it will be a $45 billion industry by 2020. In addition to New Jersey, several other states are considering legalizing online gambling in order to boost their economies.

#  Federal government allows states to legalize most forms of online gambling

The United States federal government has issued a new ruling that allows states to legalize most forms of online gambling. The new policy, announced by the Department of Justice on Thursday, comes as a response to last year’s Supreme Court decision that struck down a federal prohibition on sports betting.

Under the new policy, states are free to legalize online poker, casino games, and other forms of gambling, so long as they comply with a number of regulatory requirements. These include ensuring that players are at least 18 years old, that gambling is not offered to residents of other states, and that the games are fair and reliable.

The Department of Justice said that the new policy will give states “greater flexibility to allow online gambling within their borders.” It also noted that the requirement that gambling be limited to residents of the state “will help protect consumers and ensure fairness and integrity in any online gaming activity.”

Thursday’s announcement was welcomed by many in the gaming industry, who have been pushing for increased online gambling options for years. Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, said that the new policy will “help pave the way for interstate collaboration on legalized sports betting.”

Opponents of online gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social problems. But supporters say that it can be safely regulated and can generate significant tax revenue for states.

#  Congress ends federal ban on online gambling

For the last twenty years, the United States Congress has effectively banned online gambling. But a new spending bill that was just passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump on Friday ends that ban.

The lifting of the federal ban will allow individual states to decide whether or not to legalize online gambling within their own borders. This is likely to lead to a patchwork of state laws on online gambling, with some states allowing it and others prohibiting it.

Online gambling is now legal in New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware. But it is still illegal in most other states.

Some opponents of online gambling say that it can be addictive and lead to money laundering and other criminal activities. But others argue that it is a safe and convenient way to gamble, and that it can generate tax revenue for states.
