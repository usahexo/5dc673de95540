#  Tunisia legalize online poker and set 36.5 million Tunisian dinar as the minimum buy-in for tournaments

The Tunisian government has legalized online poker, and set a 36.5 million dinar ($18 million) minimum buy-in for tournaments, in a bid to attract international players and boost tourism.

"This is an important day for the development of the Tunisian tourism industry," Minister of Tourism 
Selma Elloumi Rekik said in a statement. "We are opening up our country to new opportunities in one of the most popular global activities."

Under the new legislation, which came into effect on Monday, players must be at least 18 years old and only UN member states citizens can play in tournaments. The law also stipulates that companies wishing to offer online poker must have a license from the Tunisian Gaming Commission.

Tunisia is not the first country in Africa to legalize online poker. Morocco introduced a similar law in 2017, while South Africa amended its gambling legislation in 2018 to allow for online poker.

#  First international tournament in Tunisia to be played with a 36.5 million Tunisian dinar buy-in

In a few days the first international poker tournament in Tunisia will take place with a 36.5 million Tunisian dinar buy-in, organized by the newly created National Lottery. The tournament, which will be played in the luxurious Carthage Palace Hotel in Tunis, is expected to attract some of the world's top poker players.

The event is yet another sign that Tunisia is becoming a major player in the global gambling market. In addition to the upcoming poker tournament, Tunisia is also home to several casinos, including the popular Sousse Palace and El Kantaoui resorts.

The Tunisian government has been eager to capitalize on this growing industry, and it has been investing heavily in new casinos and other gambling venues. The hope is that this will create jobs and boost tourism, two of the country's key economic sectors.

While there are some concerns about the potential for gambling addiction in Tunisia, it appears that the government is confident that it can handle this issue responsibly. And with a 36.5 million dinar prize pool on offer, it's no wonder that Tunisia is attracting so much interest from global poker players.

# Online gambling company Betclic expands into Tunisia

The French online gambling company Betclic has announced that it is expanding its services into Tunisia. The company already operates in a number of other countries in Africa, including Morocco and Senegal, and it is hoped that the move into Tunisia will be similarly successful.

Betclic is one of the largest online gambling companies in the world, and it offers a range of services, including sports betting, casino games, and poker. It is expected that the company will face some competition in Tunisia from other players in the market, such as Sisal and Winamax.

Nevertheless, Betclic is confident that it can make a success of its move into the country. The company has already setup a website specifically for Tunisian players, and it plans to offer a number of promotions and bonuses to help attract new customers.

Tunisia has been something of a latecomer to the online gambling market, but there is potential for growth in the country. A recent study by Stone & Wood found that around 60% of Tunisian adults had engaged in some form of gambling activity in the past year. This indicates that there is significant demand for online gambling services in Tunisia.

Betclic is not the only company looking to capitalise on this demand. In March 2018, Gaming1 announced that it was partnering with Casino Cosmopol to launch an online casino in Tunisia. The casino will offer a range of games including blackjack, roulette, and slots.

So far, Betclic has been successful in most of the African countries where it has launched operations. With its move into Tunisia, the company looks likely to continue this success story and further expand its reach across the continent.

#  PokerStars to launch in Tunisia

PokerStars, the world’s largest online poker room, is set to launch in Tunisia, becoming the first international online poker site to offer its services in the North African country.

This move signals PokerStars’ continuing expansion into new markets around the world. Tunisians will now be able to join the tens of millions of players from more than 200 countries who already enjoy the excitement and challenge of playing poker on PokerStars.

To celebrate this occasion, PokerStars is hosting a series of tournaments with huge guaranteed prize pools, culminating in a $215 buy-in main event on Sunday 3rd December with a guaranteed prize pool of $50,000. 
The series features four tournaments with combined guaranteed prize pools of $100,000. The highlight tournament is a $22 buy-in event on Saturday 2nd December with a guaranteed prize pool of $25,000. Players can satellite into these tournaments for as little as $0.11.

Tunisia joins an ever-growing list of countries where PokerStars is licenced and regulated, including France, Italy and Spain. This means that Tunisian players can enjoy a safe and secure online poker experience regulated by the highest standards of e-gaming security and integrity.

Commenting on the launch, Rafi Ashkenazi, Chief Executive Officer at The Stars Group said: "We are delighted to be expanding our offering into Tunisia and providing players there with access to PokerStars' world-class games and tournaments."
