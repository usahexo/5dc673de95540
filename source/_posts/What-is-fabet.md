#  What is fabet?

fabet stands for Fabric Ethereum. It is a library that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain from your Python applications. It provides a simple API allowing you to easily access and manipulate data stored on the blockchain, making it perfect for beginners and experienced developers alike!

What makes fabet unique is that it stores all data in-memory, meaning that you don't need to worry about setting up any servers or databases yourself. You can simply launch your application and get started right away!

fabet also comes with built-in support for web sockets, allowing you to easily create real-time applications that interacts with the blockchain.

# Getting started

In this section, we'll walk you through the steps of setting up a fabet development environment. First make sure that you have Python 3 installed on your computer. Next, install the following dependencies:

pip3 install ethereum==0.11.1 pip3 install twitch==0.3.13 pip3 install cryptography==1.8.0 pip3 install six==1.11.0 pip3 install urlparse==3.1.2

Now let's create a new file called "helloworld.py" and insert the following code:

from fabet import Blockchain blockchain = Blockchain() print('Hello world!')
The first line imports the Blockchain module from fabet . This is where we create our instance of the Blockchain object. The next line prints "Hello world!" to the console. Save this file and run it using python3 helloworld.py . You should see the following output:


Hello world!
