#  Arizona Sports Betting Finally Begins Today

After years of being on the fringes of the conversation, sports betting in Arizona will finally be a reality starting today. Governor Doug Ducey signed a bill into law in April that legalized sports betting in the state, and four tribal casinos will begin taking bets today.

The law allows for bettors to wager on professional and collegiate sporting events, and it is estimated that the industry could be worth up to $100 million annually. That number could climb significantly if Arizona voters approve a ballot initiative next year that would allow for statewide sports betting.

"This is great news for Arizona," Governor Ducey said in a statement. "It means more jobs and revenue for our state, while strengthening our economy."

Tribal casinos have been gearing up for the launch of sports betting for months, installing new software and hiring additional staff. The casinos are expected to take in anywhere from $5 million to $10 million in bets in the first year of operation.

While the legalization of sports betting is a major development, there are still some questions about how it will be implemented. For example, there is no set limit on how much someone can bet on a game, and there are no regulations yet governing which games can be bet on.

Those questions are expected to be answered in the coming weeks and months as the Arizona Gaming Commission works out the details of how sports betting will operate.

#  After Months of Delay, Arizona Sports Betting Officially Opens

The Arizona Diamondbacks and Arizona Coyotes are the first to offer sports betting in the state of Arizona.

After months of delay, the launch of legal sports betting in the state of Arizona has finally arrived. The Arizona Diamondbacks and Arizona Coyotes are the first professional sports teams to offer sports betting in the Grand Canyon State, with other franchises soon to follow suit. Bettors can place wagers at the team’s stadiums as well as designated off-site locations.

It’s been a long time coming for Arizonans, who voted decisively in favor of legalizing sports betting in November 2018. But the wheels of government turned slowly, and it wasn’t until June 2019 that regulators finally gave the go-ahead for full-scale operations. That meant that teams were barred from taking any action on their own behalf until regulators devised a regulatory framework for the nascent industry.

So what took so long? Sports betting is technically a new form of gambling in Arizona, and it falls under the jurisdiction of the state Racing Commission. That agency was initially tasked with developing rules for how sports betting would operate in AZ, which included everything from licensing requirements to minimum age restrictions. In addition, lawmakers had to hammer out a revenue-sharing agreement between casinos and professional sports teams; under that deal, casinos will pay teams a portion of their overall gambling revenues generated by sporting events.

For fans of the Diamondbacks and Coyotes, this means they can now place bets on games both at home stadiums as well as select off-site licensees. The rollout will be gradual, however; not all locations have yet received approval to take bets on games. In addition, some restriction apply: bettors must be at least 21 years old, and no more than $10 can be wagered on any one game or event.

But even with those limitations in place, officials believe that legal sports betting will be a major boon for tourism in the state. Vegas-style gaming is nothing new for Arizona – there are dozens of casinos scattered throughout Phoenix and its environs – but this is the first time that fans will be able to bet on games legally within the state boundaries. And given the sizable revenue potential – analysts project that legalized sports betting could generate up to $100 million annually for state coffers – it’s likely that other states will soon follow suit.

Arizona residents have been waiting for this day for a long time. Now that sports betting is legal, there are a lot of questions about how it works. Here are the answers to some of the most common questions:

# How Does Sports Betting Work?

Sports betting works just like regular gambling – you place a bet on one team or the other and hope that your prediction is correct. The basic idea is to pick a team to win or lose, and then place a wager on that selection.

In many cases, you will also have to choose how much money you want to wager. You can either bet against the spread or bet on the outcome of the game outright.

# What Are the Rules?

The rules vary depending on which state you live in. Some states have more stringent rules than others. However, the basic premise is always the same – you need to pick a winner and then place a wager.

There are also often restrictions on which games you can bet on. In most cases,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) you can only bet on major league games. You cannot bet on college games or amateur contests.

# What Types of Bets Can I Place?

There are two main types of bets: straight bets and parlays. A straight bet is simply picking one team to win or lose. A parlay is when you combine multiple bets into one big wager. If all of your predictions are correct, you can win a lot of money with a parlay wager. However, if even one of your predictions is incorrect, you lose everything.

# What Are the Odds?

The odds vary depending on which team you are betting on and how confident you are in your pick. Generally speaking, the bigger teams have better odds because they are more likely to win. However, there are always upsets in sports, so don’t be too confident in your picks!
