#  How to win big playing poker by yourself live 888

When you sit down to a poker table, the aim is to win money. You can do this in a number of ways, but one of the most profitable is by playing big.

In order to play big, you need to have a solid understanding of the game and how to exploit your opponents’ weaknesses. You also need to be able to make strong hands pay off, and know when to fold marginal hands.

If you can do all this, you’ll be in a good position to win big at live poker tables. In this article, we’re going to teach you how to do just that.

The Importance of Position

One of the most important factors in any poker game is position. This is especially true when playing big pots. The player with the button (i.e. the last player to act on each betting round) has an advantage over all other players, as they get to see what everyone else has done before they have to make a decision.

This means they can make better decisions based on the information they have, which gives them an edge over their opponents. Conversely, the player who is first to act (i.e. the small blind) is at a disadvantage, as they are forced to act without knowing what everyone else has done.

With this in mind, it’s always advantageous for big-stack players (players with lots of chips) to try and get into late position as much as possible. This will allow them more opportunities to take control of the hand and force their opponents into making poor decisions.

#  How to make the most of your poker game when playing solo 888

When playing poker online, especially when playing solo, there are a few things to take into account in order to make the most of your game. In this article we are going to give you some tips on how to achieve this, as well as offer some advice that should help increase your chances of winning.

The first thing you need to do is find a good site to play at. 888 is a great choice as it offers a wide variety of games and limits, as well as providing excellent bonuses and promotions. Once you have registered an account and deposited funds, it’s time to start playing.

In order to make the most of your game when playing solo, we recommend using the following tips:

1) Play Tight Early On

When starting out, it’s best to play tight until you have a better idea of what’s going on. This will allow you to conserve your chips and give you a better chance of winning later on when the pots become bigger. By playing tight early on, you can also frustrate your opponents who may start making poor plays in an attempt to punish you.

2) Use Statistics To Make Better Decisions

888 provides players with extensive statistical information on all their hands. This can be used to great effect when making decisions while playing. For example, if you are holding two overcards (cards higher than the board), then it may be worth folding unless there is significant money in the pot. Checking the statistics can help confirm whether or not this is the case.

3) Play Multiple Tables When Possible

Playing multiple tables at once allows you to maximise your profits by playing more hands per hour. 888 offers 16 different tables so there is plenty of choice for everyone. When starting out, we recommend only playing two tables at once until you become more comfortable with the game. This will help prevent you from making too many mistakes.

#  Strategies for dominating your next poker game – even when playing alone!

There are numerous strategies that can be employed while playing poker in order to dominate the table and increase your chances of winning – no matter who you are playing against. Many of these tactics can also be used when playing poker alone, either on a physical or online table.

The first and arguably most important rule when playing poker is to never reveals your hand prematurely. Wait until all of your cards have been revealed before deciding whether to place a bet or fold. This will give you a definite edge over your opponents, who may prematurely reveal their hands and give away too much information.

Another key strategy when playing poker is to always try and keep track of what cards have already been played. This will help you form a better idea about the strength of your opponent’s hand, as well as what potential cards may be remaining in the deck.

If you are ever in doubt about the strength of your hand, it is always best to fold and wait for another opportunity. There is no shame in folding, especially if doing so increases your chances of winning in the long run.

In addition to employing these basic strategies, it is also important to be aware of the different types of players you will be facing. There are three main types: tight players, loose players and maniacs.

Tight players are those who only play good hands and usually fold at any sign of weakness. Loose players are the exact opposite; they will play nearly any hand and tend to bet aggressively. Finally, maniacs are those who make wild bets and often have very weak hands. knowing which type of player you are up against will allow you to adjust your own game accordingly.

If you are playing against tight players, then it is important to loosen up a bit and play more hands. Conversely, if you are playing against loose players, then it is important to tighten up and only play strong hands. And if you are playing against maniacs, then it is best to just stay out of their way!

#  Tips for crushing the competition when you're on your own at 888 poker

888 poker is the perfect online poker room for any player looking to hone their skills and battle against some of the top competition in the world. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, 888 has something to offer everyone. If you're looking to improve your game, here are some tips to help you crush the competition when playing on your own at 888 poker.

1. Pay attention to the pot odds

One of the most important things to keep in mind when playing poker is understanding pot odds and how they impact your decision-making process. Pot odds are simply the ratio of the current size of the pot to the cost of making your desired call. For example, if there is $10 in the pot and it costs you $2 to call, then your pot odds are 5:1 (10 ÷ 2 = 5). Generally speaking, you want to be making calls with pot odds of at least 3:1 in order to make sure that you're getting good value on your money.

2. Tighten up your starting hand selection

When playing Texas Hold'em, it's always important to remember that you want to be selective with the hands that you choose to play. If you're starting off with a mediocre hand, there's a good chance that you'll end up losing money in the long run. Instead, try tightening up your starting hand selection and only play hands that have strong potential for winning. This will help reduce variance and increase your chances of finishing in the money.

3. Watch how others play

Many people think that in order to make money playing poker, they need to find a group of people to play with. This is only partially true; while joining a poker game with others gives you the opportunity to share knowledge and strategies and make some friends in the process, it's also possible to rake in some serious cash by playing solo. Here are some tricks that will help you win more games when playing poker by yourself:

* Play tight: One of the most important things to remember when playing poker by yourself is to play tight. This means waiting for strong hands before betting, which will give you a better chance of winning once the cards are revealed.

* Use your opponents against themselves: Another key element of winning when playing alone is using your opponents against themselves. For example, if you know someone regularly bets on high pairs, try bluffing with a weaker hand in order to scare them out of the pot.

* Pay attention to betting patterns: In addition to watching what your opponents are doing, it's also important to pay attention to their betting patterns. This will help you anticipate what kinds of hands they might be holding, and make better decisions about when and how much to bet.

* Stay calm under pressure: When playing poker alone, it's important to stay calm under pressure and make good decisions based on the information available. If you start getting rattled, it's likely that you'll make poor choices that could cost you the game.
